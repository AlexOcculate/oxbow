### Code Contributions

Do you have a new cool feature that you'd like to contribute? Or a fix for a bug? 
Great! The Oxbow project loves code contributions, improvements, and bugfixes, but we require that they
follow a set of guidelines and that they are contributed in a specific
way.

##### Code Formatting

All code contributed to the Oxbow project tree should follow [Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language]
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html), and  should be have no tabs. All the tabs should be replaced with spaces.


> ##### Advice for Contributors


>The chance of getting your pull request accepted increases considerably
if you adhere to the following rules in addition to the aforementioned
formatting  standards:

>* Ensure that all contributed files have a valid copyright statement
  and an open-source license.
>* Do not bundle commits that are unrelated to each other -- create
  separate pull requests instead.
>* Clean up the commit history. "git rebase -i" is useful for this purpose.
>* Write a descriptive pull request message. Explain the advantages and
  disadvantages of your proposed changes.
>* Before starting to work on a major contribution, discuss your idea
  with existing Oxbow contributorsto avoid wasting time on things that have no chance of
  getting merged into Oxbow.
